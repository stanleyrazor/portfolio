<h1>Introduction</h1>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>High-dimensional data is the type of data<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> which is characterized by the presence of many variables<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Due to the growing nature of variables of interest and data collection over the past years in diverse domains such as health-care/medicine, marketing, finance etc., there is an increasing need for techniques which are able to thrive in situations where the number of variables is higher, and at times even more than the number of data points available to train the model.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn1"><p><sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Also known as wide data</p></li><li id="fn2"><p><sup>2</sup>&nbsp;potentially where the number of variables(p) is greater than the number of observations in the sample(n) i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(p &gt; n\)</span>.</p></li><li id="fn3"><p><sup>3</sup>&nbsp;For most Machine Learning algorithms, data at hand is usually of the form <span class="math inline">\(n &gt;&gt; p\)</span>, i.e.&nbsp;the number of data points(n) used in training the model is far higher than the number of predictors(p) in the data. However for high dimensional Machine Learning, the number of predictors(p) is usually very large, and at times more than the sample size(n), which poses a problem for most Machine Learning models.</p></li></div></div>
<p>Examples of problems common in high dimensional learning include the following:</p>
<p>Predicting consumer behavior and patterns in online-shopping stores, where the variables of interest, could be all search terms entered by the consumer, the click history, previous purchases and declines, demographic characteristics, and search account history. In such a problem, while the number of predictors for online behavior are many, we typically only have a few customer information.</p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Signal generation, and price prediction in finance. In this domain, the variables of interest are usually: technical indicators of the price series such as the moving averages, volatility, etc, the fundamental indicators such as market capitalization and several accounting ratios, analyst ratings, social media sentiment etc. In this domain too, the number of historical data points used to train models is often limited<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, however the number of predictors keeps growing.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn4"><p><sup>4</sup>&nbsp;at least not for high-frequency trading domain</p></li></div></div>
<p>In medicine, a problem of interest is to predict whether given tumors are benign or malignant, where variables would include a number of characteristics of cells e.g.&nbsp;perimeter, concavity, area, smoothness etc and other variables about the patient such as patient’s demographic characteristics, lifestyle characteristics etc. The characteristics could be so many, yet the number of patients, for which we have data could be few due to patients leaving studies/treatment.</p>
<hr>
<p>The challenges associated with learning in high dimensions, require specialized techniques suited to such data since common statistical learning methods such as least squares fail in such dimensions. Potential dangers encountered when working with high-dimensional data include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Multi-collinearity: In the presence of a high number of predictors, the possibility of more than one pair of predictors being highly correlated increases, and this poses a challenge termed multi-collinearity in the data.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Several machine learning models become unstable in the presence of multi-collinearity such as Neural networks, support vector machines etc, while some of them may break down completely such as multiple linear regression. Multi-collinearity introduces redundancy in model fitting, since two or more predictors attempt to explain the same variability in the response.</p></li>
<li><p>False positive discoveries: In high dimension data, the probability of finding one or more predictors which are significantly related to the response due to random chance and not due to a true relationship increases, which leads to the problem of false discoveries. Such false positive findings often decrease a model’s performance and hurt model interpretability.</p></li>

<li><p>Over-fitting: In high dimensional data, where <span class="math inline">\(n = p\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; p\)</span>, then over-fitting is likely to occur.

This is illustrated in the following example: Suppose we have a sample of 2 data points, and one variable of interest(together with an intercept) i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(n = p\)</span>, then fitting a linear regression model results in a perfect fit (all residuals become 0), however such a model may fail to generalize to previously unseen data(test data).

<h1>Models for high-dimensional data</h1>
<p>Due to the above-mentioned challenges, this study seeks to investigate models suitable for high-dimensional learning in the context of regression and classification.</p>
<p>In modelling high-dimensional data, it is of interest to identify variables and interactions which have a significant relationship to the response variable, and discard those which have no significant relationship. This leads to dropping some variables in the analysis in favor of others <em>(by setting their coefficients in the model to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>)</em>, a technique commonly called <strong>feature/variable selection</strong>, or shrinking their coefficients in the model towards <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, a technique termed <strong>shrinkage.</strong> In this study, the models used for shrinkage and variable selection are the Ridge and LASSO regression respectively. Both ridge and LASSO regression are commonly called <em>Penalized regression models</em> and are also referred to as regularization techniques since they control for possible over-fitting in models.</p>
<p>Due to the ‘wide’ nature of data in high-dimensional settings, it is of interest to an analyst, to find a small subset of predictors, which have the most significance relation to the response. This can be achieved by transformations for reducing the dimensionality of the predictor space into a much smaller dimension, a technique known as: <strong>dimensionality reduction</strong>. The aim of the these methods is to find a subset of predictors, from the original predictor space, in such a manner that the high-dimensional problem is reduced to a low-dimensional one. It is important to note that: since the subset of predictors is constructed in such a way, that there is no correlation among the new subset of predictors, the issue of multi-collinearity is also solved. In this study we investigate the following dimensionality reduction techniques: Principle Components analysis, Kernel Principal Components analysis, Independent component analysis, and Partial least squares.</p>

<section id="penalized-regression-methods" class="level1">
<h1>Penalized regression methods</h1>
<section id="ridge-regression" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ridge-regression">Ridge regression</h2>
<p>This is a shrinkage based method for regression (suitable for <span class="math inline">\(p &gt; n\)</span> data), which aims to supplement the Ordinary Least Squares method, especially in the context of high multi-collinearity.</p>
<p>Recall, that for the orindary least squares model of the form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_p x_p + \epsilon_t\]</span></p>
<p>The error function is of the form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q = \sum{(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[where: \hat{y_i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_p x_p\]</span></p>
<p>In slving for the coefficients of regression, we obtain the following closed-form solution:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} (X^T Y)\]</span></p>
<p>However, in the prescence of many predictors, there is the ever-present risk of multi-collinearity, and thus the <span class="math inline">\((X^T X)\)</span> matrix will not be of full rank, and hence not invertible. This in turn makes the coefficients of the regression model to grow large and unstable.</p>
<p>A work around is to change the error function of the regression model to be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q_{L2} = \sum{(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2} + \lambda_r \sum{\beta^2_j}\]</span></p>
<p>This choice of error function, has the advantage that the error function remains a quadratic function of the regression coefficients, and its exact closed-form solution can be obtained by equating the gradient of the error function to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, and solving for <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> to obtain:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\beta = (X^T X + \lambda I)^{-1} (X^T Y)\]</span></p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is called a penalty term or regularization coefficient, and this technique is called <strong>ridge regression</strong>. The penalty term must increase when the coefficients grow large, in order to enforce minimization. In result, the penalty causes the regression coefficients to become smaller and shrink towards 0, this makes the model much interpretable.</p>
<p>This particular choice of regularizer is known as <em>weight decay</em> in machine learning, or <em>parameter shrinkage</em> in statistics, since it has the tendancy to shrink parameter values towards 0</p>
</section>
<section id="lasso-regression" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="lasso-regression">LASSO regression</h2>
<p>A different choice of the regularizer could be obtained using the following error function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q_{L1} = \sum{(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2} + \lambda_L \sum{|\beta_j|}\]</span></p>
<p>This method is called: <em>Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator</em>: <strong>(LASSO)</strong>. In modifying the error function to include the regularizer, lasso regression forces some regression coefficients to be 0, and in doing so, it practically selects model terms to an optimal number of predictors. This makes it a feature selection model.</p>
<p>The advantage of the LASSO regression over ridge regression is that: although ridge regression shrinks parameter estimates towards 0, it does not lead to any parameter estimates being 0, hence for the ridge regression, all (p) predictors are included in the model <em>(which might hurt model interpretability)</em>. However, for the LASSO regression, the nature of its regularizer ensures that some parameter estimates are set to 0, hence effectively eliminating them from the model. Hence the LASSO regression has he advantage of producing simpler interpretable models than ridge regression. It should be noted however that this does not hurt the predictive ability of the ridge regression model.</p>

<section id="elastic-net-regression-combining-ridge-and-lasso-regression" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="elastic-net-regression-combining-ridge-and-lasso-regression">Elastic-Net Regression (Combining Ridge and LASSO regression)</h2>
<p>Since ridge regression has the advantage of combating multi-collinearity, and the LASSO regression has the advantage of being a feature/variable selection model, the two models can be combined, in order to deal with both multi-collinearity, and feature selection at once.</p>
<p>The form of the error function of model is shown below:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q = \sum{(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2} + \lambda [ (1 - \alpha)\sum{\beta^2_j} + \alpha \sum{| \beta_j |} ]\]</span></p>
<p>Here, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda = \lambda_r + \lambda_L\)</span> , and the proportion of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> associated with the lasso is denoted <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>. Thus, selecting <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 1\)</span> would be a full lasso penalty model, selecting <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0\)</span> would be a full ridge regression model, whereas <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 0.5\)</span> is an even mix of a ridge and lasso model.</p>
</section>
<section id="search-for-optimal-lambda" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="search-for-optimal-lambda">Search for optimal <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span></h2>
<p>The optimal value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> for the ridge and LASSO regression model is found by means of cross-validation, where several choices of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> are used on the training set, and the performance of the models are evaluated on a validation set,so that the value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> which yields the least training error, is preferred. For Elastic-Net regression, a common method of selecting the best regularization coefficient, is to construct a grid of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> values, and for each value of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, the best regularization coefficient <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is found. The fitted models are then compared based on validation error.</p>

<h1>Dimensionality Reduction methods</h1>
<p>Dimensionality reduction methods are useful in reducing the dimensionality of datasets, from a high-dimensional space to a low dimensional space, for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>High-dimensional data increases computation time in model fitting</p></li>
<li><p>High-dimensional data is often plagued with highly correlated variables.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These challenges above necessitate, finding only a small subset of predictors which summarize maximal variability in the original predictor space significantly. Such methods include:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Principal Components Analysis (PCA)</p></li>
<li><p>Kernel Principal Components Analysis (K-PCA)</p></li>
<li><p>Independent Component Analysis (ICA)</p></li>
<li><p>Partial Least Squares (PLS)</p></li>
<li><p>Non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>All the techniques listed above work by taking an input matrix <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, which is an <span class="math inline">\(n * p\)</span> matrix, and return a matrix of scores <em>(often called components)</em>, which are combinations of the columns of the original data matrix.</p>
<p>It is however important to note that <span class="math inline">\(PCA, K-PCA, ICA, NNMF\)</span> are <em>unsupervised</em> techniques, and their aim is to reduce the number of predictors into a subspace of predictors, with the hope that the new subset of predictors will be significant in explaining the variability in the response, although this is not always the case. Their aim is to reduce the predictor space into a smaller subset with the aim of reducing computation time and possible multi-collinearity, but not necessarily improve predictive performance.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(PLS\)</span> technique is a <em>supervised</em> technique, in that it performs dimensionality reduction, while ensuring that the subset of predictors obtained is significantly related to the response variable. Thus, when using PLS, there is some guarantee of improving predictive performance, while reducing computation time in model fitting.</p>
<p>In this article, we will not cover the non-negative matrix factorization method.</p>

</div></div><p>Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is the most popular dimensionality reduction method.

We then create a <span class="math inline">\(p*p\)</span> matrix, whose columns are eigen vectors of <span class="math inline">\((X^T X)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The matrix <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is the matrix of unit eigen vectors. In constructing <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>, we usually ensure that eigen vectors are ranked by the highest eigen value i.e.&nbsp;components with the highest explanatory power come first. It follows that <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is orthogonal, i.e.&nbsp;<span class="math inline">\(W^T = W^{-1}\)</span></p>
<p>The principal components decomposition <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is then defined as: <span class="math inline">\(P= XW\)</span></p>
<p>A popular application of principal components analysis is <em>principal components regression</em>, where the predictor matrix is first reduced into a matrix of scores using PCA, and this matrix of scores is then fed into regression.</p>

<p>Recall that PCA is useful in forming component by extracting linear combinations of predictors from the original predictor space, hence it is useful only when there are linear patterns in the predictor space.</p>
<p>But supposing that, the functional form of the data at hand is given by the following equation below:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[y = x_1 + x_2 + x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \epsilon_t\]</span></p>
<p>Then, using PCA will only construct linear combinations of <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_2\)</span>, thus missing out the important quadratic relationships in the data.</p>
<p>Thus in the presence of possible non-linear relationships in the data, Kernel-PCA is better suited.</p>
<p>K-PCA extends PCA using kernel methods, so that for linear combinations of variables, K-PCA captures this using the linear kernel:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[k(x_1, x_2) = x_1^Tx_2\]</span></p>
<p>Although the linear kernel could be substituted using any other kernel of choice, such as the polynomial kernel:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[k(x_1, x_2) = &lt;x_1, x_2&gt;^d\]</span> so that for quadratic relationships, we set <span class="math inline">\(d = 2\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[k(x_1, x_2) = &lt;x_1, x_2&gt;^2 = (x_{11}x_{12} + ... + x_{n1}x_{n2})^2 \]</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Minimization of mutual Information</li>
</ul>
<p>For a pair of random variables <span class="math inline">\(X, Y\)</span>, the mutual information is defined as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I(X;Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y)\]</span> Where:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H(X)\)</span>: is the entropy of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H(X) = - \sum_x{P(x)\log{P(x)}}\]</span></p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p><span class="math inline">\(H(X|Y)\)</span>: is the conditional entropy.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14" role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn14"><p><sup>14</sup>&nbsp;The entropy of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> conditional on <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> taking a certain value <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span></p></li></div></div>

<p><span class="math display">\[H(X, Y) = - \sum_{x, y}{P(x, y) \log{P(x, y)}}\]</span></p>
<p>From the above equations, entropy can be seen as a measure of uncertainty of information in a random variable, so that the lower the value of entropy, the more information we have about the random variable of interest. Therefore by seeking for a method of maximizing mutual information, we would be seeking for components which are maximally independent.</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximization of non-gaussianity.</li>
</ul>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>This is a second method of constructing independent components. Since in the assumptions underlying ICA, is the assumption of non-gaussianity of the source signals, then, one way of extracting components is to maximize non-gaussianity of the components.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15" role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a>.</p><div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><li id="fn15"><p><sup>15</sup>&nbsp;Forcing the components to be as far as possible from the gaussian distribution</p></li></div></div>
<p>An example of a non-gaussianity measure is the <em>Negentropy</em>, given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[N(X) = H(X^N) - H(X)\]</span></p>
<p>Where:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>: is a random non-gaussian vector.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(X^N\)</span>: is a gaussian random vector with same covariance matrix as <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H(.)\)</span>: is the entropy.</p>
<p>Sice the gaussian distribution has the highest entropy for any given covariance matrix,then the negentropy: <span class="math inline">\(N(X)\)</span> is a strictly positive measure of non-gaussianity.</p>

<section id="partial-least-squares" class="level2 page-columns page-full">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="partial-least-squares">Partial Least Squares</h2>
<p>Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a <em>supervised</em> dimensionality reduction method, in that the response variable is used in guiding the dimensionality reduction process unlike in the context of PCA. Hence in constructing the components, PLS does so in a way that the components not only summarize maximal variability in the predictor space, but also are related to the response significantly.</p>
<p>Given <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> predictors: <span class="math inline">\(X_1, X_2, ... , X_p\)</span>, and the response variable <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, we construct linear combinations of our original predictors: <span class="math inline">\(Z_1, ..., Z_m, \hspace{2 mm} m &lt; p\)</span>, components:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z_m = \sum_{j=1}^p {\phi_{jm} X_j}\]</span></p>
<div class="page-columns page-full"><p>Where: <span class="math inline">\(\phi_{jm}\)</span>: are some constants.

<p>It is evident that there exists (both positive and negative) high correlation between the predictors, which poses a challenge if multi-collinearity in the model fitting process. The high positive correlation is visible in predictors which are related to measures of downside risk, while the high negative correlation is evident between variables which measure tail risk, and those which measure downside risk. There is little to no correlation between variables which measure central tendancy (mean and median returns, and their respective ratios) and the variables which measure the riskiness of the returns series.</p>
<p>For both models, the training and testing sets are constructed from the data using simple random sampling of the original data, so that 80% of the full dataset goes into training the models, while the remaining 20% of the data goes to the testing data. For the classification model, the resulting subsets are analyzed to ensure that there is class balance in the response variable.</p>
<p>The key reason we randomize the data, when splitting into training and testing set, is because, for the purpose of this analysis, we are not interested in the temporal structure of the data.</p>
<p>In the regression setting, the predictor variables are lagged by one time period, so that the financial metrics of of quarter <span class="math inline">\(i-1\)</span> are used in predicting the return for quarter <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. In the classification setting, since the Direction variable is automatically lagged, we back-shift it, so that, the financial metrics of quarter <span class="math inline">\(i-1\)</span>, are used in predicting the Direction of the next quarter <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. This is necessary since, it helps us in mitigating look-ahead bias.</p>

<p>The model fitted using the regularization parameter obtained from cross validation as shown above has forced majority of the model coefficients to be 0, thereby removing the variables from the model. The LASSO regression technique is therefore important in variable selection, since by setting some model coefficients to 0, it effectively removes them from the model, leaving us with a much smaller and interpretable model.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="elastic-net-regression">Elastic Net Regression</h2>
<p>In this section, we fit an Elastic Net model, which is a mixture of both ridge and LASSO regression. We select the mixing-weight based on two methods:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We compute the model regularization parameter <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, as a sum of the cross validation value of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> computed in ridge regression, and that computed from LASSO regression. i.e.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[\lambda = \lambda_R + \lambda_L\]</span> We then run a cross validation using this fixed <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> on several values of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, and obtain the statistics as shown in the following chart:</p>

The value of alpha = 0.386387387, and the corresponding lambda = 0.1106008, gave the lowest training error(0.4), as well as the highest deviance(37%), using only 19 non-zero model coefficients.</p></li></div><div class="cell" data-hash="index_cache/html/elnet2_27e18e2a9c575a646b09352201f89fdb">

<p>From the above chart, it shows that, as the value of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> increases, then the regularization parameter <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> reduces, which shows that for this model, a very small proportion of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> was attributed to the LASSO penalty. The deviance resulting from this is quite low (less than 30%). The training error, as well as the deviance are suitable for small values of alpha chosen. For the Elastic Net regression, we will proceed with this <span class="math inline">\(2^{nd}\)</span> model hyper-parameters, since it gives a lower training error, for few variables, as compared to the rest.</p>

<p>In this section, the Kernel-PCA is first performed on the predictor matrix, and then the most optimal subset of the resulting components constructed is used to fit a linear regression model on our training dataset. For the Kernel-PCA, we chose a radial basis kernel, where the hyper-parameter <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> was chosen automatically based on our data.</p>

<div class="no-row-height column-margin column-container"><div class="">
<p>The estimated value of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, is based upon the 10%, and 90% quantile of <span class="math inline">\(||x - x^`||^2\)</span>, where we chose <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> as the median value of: 0.008732801.</p>

<p>From the scree plot on chart 1, it is evident that the first 4 kernel principal components explain maximal variability in the original predictor matrix. The cross validation training error increases as more components are added into the model. In selecting the optimal number of principal components to include in the model, we select 10 components, since this gives the highest amount of variability explained in the response variable.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>From the chart above, it is evident that for any number of principal components, the PLS explains the highest variability in the response variable, since it is a <em>supervised</em> dimensionality reduction technique, where the response variable guides the reduction process, as compared to the PLS which is an unsupervised technique.</p>

<p>From the above charts and statistics, it is evident that the Kernel PCA, and Elastic-Net regression model emerge the best, and their performance in both the training set and testing set is consistent. The PCR, PLS and ICA model offer a poor fit to the data in both two sets of data. The Ridge and LASSO regression models have more less the same performance in both sets of data. The performance of Kernel PCA indicates that there exists some non-linear dependencies on the data - which Kernel-PCA is good at uncovering as compared to PCA.</p>

<p>Performance of Models on the testing set</p>
</div>
</div>
<hr>
<p>From the statistics and charts above, it is evident that Kernel PCA outperforms all other models on the testing set, with an overall accuracy of 81.25%, with all other models having accuracy below 80%.</p>
<p>The good performance exhibited by Kernel PCA over PCA, shows that there were some non-linear relationships within the predictors.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level1">
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>This study compares models for high dimensional data both in the regression and classification setting. The results show that, for regression: The elastic-net regression model, and Kernel-PCA outperform the rest in terms of Mean Squared Error. For the classification models fitted, the Kernel-PCA and PCA outperform the rest of the models. The consistency of the Kernel PCA in both settings shows that the dataset contained non-linear dependencies in the predictor space - which Kernel-PCA is good at uncovering.</p>
<p>For both settings, the dimensionality reduction models used including: PCA, k-PCA, and ICA, performed well in reducing the multi-collinearity inherent in the original dataset,and all the dimensionality reduction models show optimal performance with relatively few components used in the model - which helps in pointing out how important the dimensionality reduction models are at combating multi-collinearity in the data.</p>
<p>In both settings, the hyper-parameters for the final models fitted, such as: <span class="math inline">\(\alpha, \lambda\)</span> for the ridge, LASSO and Elastic-Net models, and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, the number of components to use for the dimensionality reduction models, were obtained through cross-validation on the training set. Since most models maintained consistency in both training and testing performance, then it shows that cross-validation is useful in determining good hyper-parameter estimates, for model fitting.</p>
